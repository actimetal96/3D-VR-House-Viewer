# 3D-VR-House-Viewer

College internship project

Developing a 3D house viewer for online platforms, searches to bring new freedom and interactivity between the user and the real estate, using current and emerging technologies. 

The project models the house dynamically from a set of room and furniture coordinates, enabling changes on the real estate in real-time. We can view the real estate in 3 different view modes, both for desktop and mobile devices.

Incorporating virtual reality technologies, the user can walk through the real estate in a more personal and real experience. Besides the virtual reality mode, its possible to view the house from a broad perspective and in First-person experience. 

The virtual reality and house modelling aspects of the solution are subject to future improvements.
