# 3D-VR-House-Viewer

College internship project

Developing a 3D house viewer for online platforms, searches to bring new freedom and interactivity between the user and the real estate, using current and emerging technologies. 

The project models the house dynamically from a set of room and furniture coordinates, enabling changes on the real estate in real-time. We can view the real estate in 3 different view modes, both for desktop and mobile devices.

*Overview Mode:
  +Zoom In/Out Feature
  +Fly around the house
  
*First-person Mode:
  +Navigate inside the house
  
*Virtual Reality Mode (Desktop):
  +look Arround feeling
  +A more personal experience

The virtual reality and house modelling aspects of the solution are subject to future improvements.
